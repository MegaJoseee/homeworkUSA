            <div class="text">
                Drugs have a devastating impact on the human body. They affect the brain, causing addiction and
                disrupting normal bodily functions. Long-term drug use can lead to serious illnesses such as heart
                disease, liver disease, kidney disease, as well as mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and
                psychosis. Drugs can lead to death, both as a result of overdose and due to related health
                complications.
