            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Alcohol has a multifaceted effect on the human body. Short-term consequences of alcohol consumption
                include impaired coordination, slowed reactions, reduced attention, mood changes, and slurred speech.
                Long-term alcohol abuse can lead to serious health problems such as liver disease (cirrhosis),
                cardiovascular disease, cancer, brain damage, and mental disorders. It is important to remember that
                alcohol consumption in any amount is associated with health risks, and the best way to avoid negative
                consequences is to abstain from alcohol or consume it in moderation.

            <div class="title">Myths about alcohol
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                There are many myths about alcohol that mislead people about its effects on the body. One of the most
                common myths is that alcohol warms you up. In fact, alcohol dilates blood vessels, which creates a
                feeling of warmth, but at the same time the body loses heat faster, which can lead to hypothermia.
                Another myth is that alcohol helps you fall asleep. Indeed, alcohol can make it easier to fall asleep,
                but it disrupts sleep structure and makes sleep less restful and restorative. It is important to
                understand the myths about alcohol and not trust them.

            <div class="title">How to give up alcohol
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Giving up alcohol can be difficult, especially if you are used to drinking in certain situations. It is
                important to develop a strategy that will help you cope with temptation. This may include avoiding
                places and situations where alcohol is consumed, seeking support from friends and family, engaging in
                new hobbies and interests that are not related to alcohol, and seeking professional help from an
                addiction specialist or therapist. Remember that giving up alcohol is an important step towards
                improving your health and well-being, and it is a very achievable goal.
