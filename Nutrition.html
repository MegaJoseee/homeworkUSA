            <div class="title">Basics of healthy eating
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Healthy eating is the foundation of good health and longevity. A balanced diet should include sufficient
                amounts of protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The main sources of protein are meat,
                fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes. Fats are necessary to maintain brain health and hormonal
                balance, but it is important to choose healthy fats, such as unsaturated fats, which are found in
                vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body, but it is
                important to choose complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Vitamins and
                minerals are essential for maintaining the health of all organs and systems of the body.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Vitamins and minerals play an important role in maintaining health and functioning. They are involved in
                many biochemical processes, support the immune system, strengthen bones, teeth, and hair, ensure normal
                functioning of the nervous system, and protect cells from damage. Lack of vitamins and minerals can lead
                to various health problems, such as fatigue, weakness, impaired immunity, and problems with skin and
                hair. It is important to consume sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals through food or through
                supplements, especially during periods of increased need, such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, and active
                growth.

            <div class="title">How to properly read food labels
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Reading food labels can be a helpful tool for making healthy food choices. On the label, you can find
                information about the composition of the product, its calorie content, and the content of proteins,
                fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. It is important to pay attention to the amount of sugar,
                salt, and saturated fat, as excessive consumption of these can lead to health problems. It is also
                helpful to compare labels of different products and choose those that contain less added sugar, salt,
                saturated fats, and trans fats, and more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Understanding food labels helps
                to make informed choices in favor of healthy eating.
