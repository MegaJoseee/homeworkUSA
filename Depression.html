            <div class="text">
                Depression is much more than just feeling down. It's a serious mental health disorder that affects how
                you feel, think, and behave. The main symptoms of depression include persistent feelings of sadness,
                loss of interest in things that used to bring pleasure, fatigue, and problems with sleep and appetite.
                It is important to understand that depression is not a weakness of character, but an illness that
                requires professional help. According to statistics, depression is one of the most common causes of
                disability worldwide, affecting millions of people of all ages and walks of life.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Coping with depression is not easy, but it is possible. The first step is to acknowledge the problem and
                seek help from a doctor or therapist. There are various treatments for depression, including medication
                and psychotherapy. In addition to professional help, it is important to take care of yourself: eat
                right, exercise, get enough sleep, and avoid stressful situations. Communicating with loved ones,
                participating in support groups, and engaging in hobbies can also help. Remember that every little step
                is important, and recovery takes time and patience.

            <div class="text">
                If you have a friend or family member suffering from depression, your support can play a huge role in
                their recovery. It is important to show empathy, listen, and support without judgment. Offer help in
                finding a specialist, accompany them to a doctor's appointment, or simply spend time together doing
                pleasant things. Remember that depression can make a person feel isolated and lonely, so your support
                and care can be a real lifesaver. Don't hesitate to offer your help and remind them that you are there
                for them.
